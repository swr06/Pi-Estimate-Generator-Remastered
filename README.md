# Pi-Estimate-Generator-Remastered
I remastered the Pi-Estimate-Generator (The program I wrote when I was about 12). It uses 64 bit unsigned long longs and long doubles instead of non-precision types. 

# The old version 
You can find the old version of the generator here : https://github.com/swr06/Pi-Estimate-Generator

# Compiing it
I used Visual Studio 2019 for this project as it is lesser error prone than Min-GW or GCC

# About the programmer 
My name is Samuel Rasquinha and I am a 14 year old C++ developer from India
